pygame.sprite.Group.update
call the update method on contained Sprites

Calls the update() method on all Sprites in the Group. The base Sprite class has an update method that takes any number of arguments and does nothing. The arguments passed to Group.update() will be passed to each Sprite.

There is no way to get the return value from the Sprite.update() methods.

round(number[, ndigits])
Return number rounded to ndigits precision after the decimal point. 
If ndigits is omitted or is None, it returns the nearest integer to its input.

For the built-in types supporting round(), 
values are rounded to the closest multiple of 10 to the power minus ndigits; 
if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done toward the even choice
(so, for example, both round(0.5) and round(-0.5) are 0, and round(1.5) is 2).
Any integer value is valid for ndigits (positive, zero, or negative). 
The return value is an integer if ndigits is omitted or None. 
Otherwise the return value has the same type as number.

For a general Python object number, round delegates to number.__round__.

Note The behavior of round() for floats can be surprising: 
for example, round(2.675, 2) gives 2.67 instead of the expected 2.68. 
This is not a bug: it’s a result of the fact that most decimal fractions
can’t be represented exactly as a float. See Floating Point Arithmetic:
Issues and Limitations for more information.
